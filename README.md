## Project Question: Do BBC and Fox News report differently on international students!
We webscraped a set of articles from BBC and Fox News, gathering 79 observations from BBC and 97 observations from Fox. The articles vary in publication date, ranging from recent posts to ones published up to 10 years ago. For the purpose of this assignment, we aim to predict the general sentiment of these articles and investigate whether there are notable differences between the two sources. My initial expectation is that Fox News’ coverage of international students may be more negative and less promising compared to BBC’s. If the model fails to pick up on any difference, it may suggest that there is, in fact, little to no difference between the two sources.
